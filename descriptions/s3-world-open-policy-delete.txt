Bucket policy World Delete
 Description
 "Bucket policy allows the world to delete the affected bucket"

 Suggested_action_brief
 "Remove or modify the bucket policy that enables the world to delete the contents of this bucket."

Detail
S3 bucket policies are a type of access control list but are different than S3 ACLs. S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied for which principals on the bucket that the bucket policy is attached to. You attach S3 bucket policies at the bucket level, but the permissions specified in the bucket policy apply to all the objects in the bucket. 

"An S3 Bucket Policy has been added that grants public access to your bucket.  Delete access has been granted to the world on the affected bucket. This allows anyone to delete your bucket content. You can use bucket policies to grant permissions to individual AWS accounts; however, it is strongly recommended that you do not grant public access to your bucket unless you are absolutely certain. Consider alternative methods to provide public access to your buckets"
