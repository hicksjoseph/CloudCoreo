### Details  
[Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) Recommendation 4.5 is to Ensure routing tables for VPC peering are "least access." [https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf#page=141](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf#page=141) 

This is a check that must be performed manually as there are either no appropriate API calls or it may require an account-specific judgement call.
