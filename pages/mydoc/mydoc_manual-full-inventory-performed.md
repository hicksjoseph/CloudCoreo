### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.1.20, 3.4.5) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), verify that the full inventory CloudCoreo composite has been executed and the results have been evaluated. This composite gives a comprehensive overview of your AWS resources. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
