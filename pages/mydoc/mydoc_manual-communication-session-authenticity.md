### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.13.15) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), it is recommended that you outline the controls implemented to protect session communications. A list of measures taken to protect these connections may provide insight into potential risk areas and potential improvements.  

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
