### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.1.15) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), It is recommended to ensure that remote access to privileged commands and security-related information is available only through a corporate VPN. This VPN should have a set username and password that the users cannot modify. A written policy should be created to govern this. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
