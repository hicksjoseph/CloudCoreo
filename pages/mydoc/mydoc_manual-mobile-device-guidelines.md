### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.1.18) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), site officials should establish guidelines for the use of mobile devices and restrict the connection of those devices as deemned appropriate. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
