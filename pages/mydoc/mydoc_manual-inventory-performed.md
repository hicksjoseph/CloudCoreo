### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.1.19) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), verify that a full inventory of your organization's cloud resources has been carried out and is carried out at regular intervals. A written policy should be created to govern this.

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
