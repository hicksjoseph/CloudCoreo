### Details  
[Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) Recommendation 1.17 is to Enable detailed billing. [https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf#page=44](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf#page=44) 

This is a check that must be performed manually as there are either no appropriate API calls or it may require an account-specific judgement call.
