### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the removal of any hardware component from its place in company property should require approval in advance by a specified individual. A written policy should be created to govern this. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
