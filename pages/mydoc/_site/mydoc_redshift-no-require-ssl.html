<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Amazon Redshift supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections to encrypt data and server certificates to validate the server certificate that the client connects to. By default, cluster databases accept a connection whether it uses SSL or not. Currently, connections to the affected Redshift cluster arenâ€™t set to require the use of SSL encryption.</p>

<h3 id="suggested-action">Suggested Action</h3>
<p>Enable Redshift to require the use of SSL encrypted connections. To configure your cluster to require an SSL connection, set the require_SSL parameter to true in the parameter group that is associated with the cluster. To support SSL connections, Amazon Redshift creates and installs a self-signed SSL certificate on each cluster. SSL support in Amazon Redshift is strictly for encrypting the connection between your client and your cluster; it should not be relied on for authenticating the server.
