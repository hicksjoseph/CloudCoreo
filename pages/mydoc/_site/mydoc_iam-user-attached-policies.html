<p>Different types of policies are for different use cases. In most cases, we recommend that you use managed policies instead of inline policies. Managed policies provide the following features: Reusability, Central change management, Versioning and rolling back, and Delegating permissions management.”

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>Using IAM, you apply permissions to IAM users, groups, and roles (which are referred to as principal entities) by creating policies. You can create two types of IAM, or identity-based policies:</p>

<p>Managed policies – Standalone policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies apply only to identities (users, groups, and roles) - not resources. You can use two types of managed policies:
AWS managed policies – Managed policies that are created and managed by AWS. If you are new to using policies, we recommend that you start by using AWS managed policies.
Customer managed policies – Managed policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Using customer managed policies, you have more precise control over your policies than when using AWS managed policies.</p>

<p>Inline policies – Policies that you create and manage, and that are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Resource-based policies are another form of inline policy. Resource-based policies are not discussed here. For more information about resource-based policies, see Identity-Based (IAM) Permissions and Resource-Based Permissions.<br />
