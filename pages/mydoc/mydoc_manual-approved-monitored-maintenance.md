### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf)(3.7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), maintenance work should be both approved and monitored, regardless of whether it takes place on or off site. A written policy should be in place to govern this. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
