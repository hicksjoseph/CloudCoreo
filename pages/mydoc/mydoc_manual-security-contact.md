### Details  
[Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) Recommendation 1.20 is to Ensure security contact information is registered. [https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf#page=60](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf#page=60) 

This is a check that must be performed manually as there are either no appropriate API calls or it may require an account-specific judgement call.
