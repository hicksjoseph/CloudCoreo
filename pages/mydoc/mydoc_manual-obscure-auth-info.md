### Details  
As per [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), authentication information should be obscured during the log-in process. For example, the characters of a user's password may be replaced by star symbols, reducing the potential for a password to be observed. This is widely the standard in authentication software.
