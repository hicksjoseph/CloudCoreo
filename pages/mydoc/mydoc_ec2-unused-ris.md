### Details  
This rule checks for any active and purchased [reserved instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html) that are not covering any active instances. This is a cost-inefficient practise. Reserved instances should ideally be maximally utilised, when purchased.
