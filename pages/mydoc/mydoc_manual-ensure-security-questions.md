### Details  
[Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) Recommendation 1.15 is to ensure security questions are registered in the AWS account. [https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf#page=40](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf#page=40) 

This is a manual check that must be performed through the AWS console because there are no API calls that allow us to automatically check if this recommendation is being followed.
