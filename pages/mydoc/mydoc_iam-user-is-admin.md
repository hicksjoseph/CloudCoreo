### Details  
This rule checks for the existence of any IAM user with administrator-level access, regardless of the method by which those permissions have been granted. This is in line with the [best practice recommendation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-access-levels-to-review-permissions) that IAM user permissions are restricted as much as possible.
