### Details  
In line with [guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) (3.1.14) published by the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), it is recommended to verify that your organization has secured all of its access-points via technologies such as SSH or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). A written policy should be created to govern this. 

'Manual' rules such as this are created when the required action cannot be carried out/audited through the AWS API. You must tread this path alone.
