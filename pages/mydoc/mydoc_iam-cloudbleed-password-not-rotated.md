### Details  
Cloudbleed is the latest internet bug that puts users private information in jeopardy. The bug was fixed by the Cloudflare team on February 20, 2017 at 21:59UTC.  

As a security best practice, we recommend that all users change their IAM user console access passwords after any sort of security event. Changing passwords limits how long a compromised password is useful to an attacker (or how long they potentially have access to your account).  

You can read more about [Cloudflare's response](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) to and description of the bug on their blog, or [CNET's high level overview](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/cloudbleed-bug-everything-you-need-to-know/).  

### Suggested Action  
Users should be asked to change their passwords if they haven't done so since February 22, 2017.
