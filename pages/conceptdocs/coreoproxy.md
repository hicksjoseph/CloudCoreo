## Coreo Proxy and Dev Time Checks  
Deploy your infrastructure as usual and weâ€™ll provide immediate feedback right in your console to let you know if there are any potential security risks or best practice violations, based on our [Cloud Audit Checks](/cloud-audit-toc.html).

The Coreo proxy works with Jenkins, AWS CLI, CloudFormation, and Terraform apply. 

### Installing the Proxy  
To install and use the proxy, you will need:
* A [CloudCoreo account](https://app.cloudcoreo.com/login) with a connected cloud account
* Docker
* AWS CLI or AWS SDK

To download the script that will install and configure the proxy, [log in](https://app.cloudcoreo.com/login) to your CloudCoreo account, click the team dropdown in the upper left, and select 'My Account.'

Then, follow the instructions to complete the installation. If you have any issues, please contact us at [info@cloudcoreo.com](mailto:info@cloudcoreo.com) and we will help you get set up.
